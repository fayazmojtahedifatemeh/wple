**Colours:** We do our best to accurately show the colour of each garment in our photos, but colours can appear slightly different depending on the lighting (natural vs artificial) and the screen you're viewing them on. If you’d like the exact **Pantone reference** for a specific colour, just get in touch — we’re happy to share it with you.

Manufacturing

- Made in London, UK.
- We are a Living Wage Employer.
- We are a Made in Britain maker.
- Fewer transport miles: where we make our clothing in London is 60 miles to where we store and ship our products from. This localised supply chain reduces emissions significantly compared to international production.

-

#### **Why Local Matters (Even if You’re Not Local)**

We make everything in small, family-run factories in North London. That means we ensure safe working conditions, fair pay, and low-impact production. It also results in a lower environmental footprint due to the proximity between the physical stages in our supply chain.

We work with material mills that are OCS certified, OEKO-TEX 100 certified, and we use FSC-certified packaging.

We produce in small batches to maximise quality and avoid waste. We offset our shipping emissions through [Ecologi](https://ecologi.com/aym-studio "https://ecologi.com/aym-studio").

For us, it’s about making better choices for people and planet — and sharing that process with you, so that you can make informed choices.

Taxes

- **No Surprise Fees - What You See is What You Pay:** We offer all-inclusive pricing globally. That means the price you see at checkout already includes any applicable taxes and duties for your destination - no hidden costs or surprise charges at delivery.
- **Returns & Duty Refunds:** Changed your mind? No problem. If you return an item, any duties or taxes paid at checkout will also be refunded. Just follow our standard returns process and we’ll take care of the rest.
- **Country-Specific Info:** Want the details? To view a breakdown of taxes and duties by country [click here](https://www.aym-studio.com/pages/global-shipping-chart)

What is a Pre Order?

- When you choose a pre-order item, we’ll begin making the garment just for you once your order is placed. This takes longer than ready-to-ship items, as each piece is cut, sewn, and finished to order.
- **Production Time:** Pre-order times typically range from **2 to 6 weeks**. The _Pre-Order Date_ shown at checkout and in your confirmation email is when we expect your garment to be completed and ready to ship.
- **Shipping:** We ship from the UK, so delivery times vary depending on your location.
- **Mixed Orders (Pre-Order + Ready to Ship):** If your order includes both pre-order and in-stock items, we’ll ship everything together once the pre-order item is ready. This helps reduce packaging and minimise environmental impact.



If you'd prefer to receive ready items sooner, please place them in a separate order.

Returns & Exchanges

- If for any reason you are not happy with your Gala Top in Organic Bamboo, there is a 30 day returns period.
- We offer **free return shipping** on exchanges.
- We also offer f **ree return shipping** when choosing **store credit**.
- To start a return, simply use our [returns portal](https://www.aym-studio.com/products/gala-top#) — it will guide you through the process and generate a return label.
- For UK returns, a **£3.99** fee is deducted from refunds to original payment. You can choose a home collection or drop-off option that suits you.

**Terms & Conditions apply.** Please see our [full returns policy](https://www.aym-studio.com/products/gala-top#) for more details.

Care

Our clothes are made to last — but how you care for them makes all the difference. Here's how to get the most wear from your garments while keeping your impact low.

- **Wash smart**: Wash cold (30°C or lower), turn garments inside out, wash with similar colours and use gentle, eco-friendly detergent. Avoid fabric softeners which can weaken natural fibres over time.
- **Air dry**: Skip the tumble dryer; air dry flat or on a line to protect fibres and save energy. Tumble dryers are tough on clothes and the planet.
- **Wear longer**: Spot clean when possible, wash by hand whenever you can, store garments properly (stretch garments are bast stored folded rather than hung), and repair when needed. We offer repairs through SOJO for UK customers.

_**Did you know?**_ _Washing one less load a week can save 38 litres of water._
